# Cartesian-plane-Euclidean-Project
## Object Oriented Programming Project 

When you run the TestClass class, 
please select the locations folder so that it can read the text document with the dots.

If we need to summarize this project, there is a list with points in our file.
- First, we read this file.
- ![Locations](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Cartesian-plane-Euclidean-Project/blob/main/ChooseLocations.png)
- We ask the user to enter a points.
- ![points](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Cartesian-plane-Euclidean-Project/blob/main/XandYCoordinate.png)
- It measures the distance of the newly entered point with all other points and specifies the class to which it belongs.
- ![belong](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Cartesian-plane-Euclidean-Project/blob/main/BelongGroup.png)
  
The codes here are a pseudocod for the user to understand how the program works.
	- read file and return list of points
	- prompt the user for a point
	- measure the distance of this new point to every  other point
 	- while keeping the smallest 3
	- Check if the smallest (distance) 3 vote for a class, then
		report it
	- if there is a draw, toss a coin
